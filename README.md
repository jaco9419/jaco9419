### Web Design
If your idea is to have a well stylished and animated website, I am the person for you. I have experience with landingpages, apps, fun interations and animations that will skyrocket your business to reach the levels you expect it to get.

### Front-end
I know well enough to create that project you have in mind. My stack takes over front-end technologies the include: HTML, CSS styling and animation, SVG, Canvas, Javascript, DOM interaction, React for incredible apps, jQuery for legacy code, SASS, Redux, Bootstrap, among others I can always look forward to learning and use!

### Back-end
At the same time, if you require someone who can help you with handling a server-side project, API requests, data management and more, I am here at your service. Things I like to use for these: Node JS, Express JS, SQLite and MongoDB.

## About Me
### Path towards software engineering
It's been several years now since I started learning to code. I first fell in love with languages, of which I can speak English, Portuguese, French and Spanish; the latter being my mother tongue. That gave me inspiration to start teaching English (I even had an institute of my own) and overcome my awkwardness when speaking to others. I then decided to major in business administration to learn about a field I consider is highly useful for the real world; but it was at that point I realized it was coding what I wanted to do.

My first resources were mainly free online courses, which were more than enough to gain inspiration, start Computer Science in college and become the person I am today and I want to be in the future.

###So, what are you waiting for, let's get in touch!
